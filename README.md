## Machine Learning

This repo contains various machine learning projects.


- `Final-Project.ipynb` is all about predicting rainfall in Australia using Support Vector Machine(SVM), K-Nearest Neighbours(KNN), Decision Tree Classifier, Logistic Regression and Linear Regression.


- `Fuel-Model.ipynb` is about predicting the CO2 Emissions of cars. This is also done using multiple linear regression.


- `Housing-ML.ipynb` is about predicting the sale price of houses using various features. Also multiple linear regression.
