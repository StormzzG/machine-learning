## Machine Learning

This repo contains various machine learning projects.


- `Final-Project.ipynb` is all about predicting rainfall in Australia using Support Vector Machine(SVM), K-Nearest Neighbours(KNN), Decision Tree Classifier, Logistic Regression and Linear Regression.


- `Fuel-Model.ipynb` is about predicting the CO2 Emissions of cars. Algorithms used are Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression and Gradient Boosting Regression. [Link](https://co2emissions-app.streamlit.app/) to the WebApp.


- `Housing-ML.ipynb` is about predicting the sale price of houses using various features. Algorithm used is Multiple Linear Regression. [Link](https://housing-app.streamlit.app/) to the WebApp.
